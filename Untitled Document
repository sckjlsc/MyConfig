ghost is right.But the directory which includes Index.h maybe different on your computer.The Index.h is on ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp/llvm/include/clang-c. So I use " sudo cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp/llvm . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp/" instead of "sudo cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=~/downloads/clang+llvm/ . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp/llvm". Then it works well.
